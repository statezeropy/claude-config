## 🧪 Test Strategy

### Testing Approach
**TDD Principle**: Write tests FIRST, then implement to make them pass

### Test Pyramid for This Feature
| Test Type | Coverage Target | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | ≥80% | Business logic, models, core algorithms |
| **Integration Tests** | Critical paths | Component interactions, data flow |
| **E2E Tests** | Key user flows | Full system behavior validation |

### Test File Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_[domain].py
│   └── test_[models].py
├── integration/
│   └── test_[feature_name].py
├── conftest.py
└── fixtures/
    └── [test_data].json
```

### Coverage Requirements by Phase
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Unit tests for core models/entities (≥80%)
- **Phase 2 (Business Logic)**: Logic + repository tests (≥80%)
- **Phase 3 (Integration)**: Component integration tests (≥70%)
- **Phase 4 (E2E)**: End-to-end user flow test (1+ critical path)

### Test Naming Convention
Follow pytest conventions:
```python
# tests/unit/test_order_service.py

class TestOrderService:
    def test_invoke_returns_valid_response(self):
        # Arrange → Act → Assert pattern
        ...

    def test_handles_api_error_gracefully(self):
        ...
```

## 📖 TDD Example Workflow

### Example: Adding LLM Summarization Chain

**Phase 1: RED (Write Failing Tests)**

```python
# tests/unit/test_summarizer.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

def test_summarize_returns_valid_response():
    # Arrange
    summarizer = Summarizer(model="gpt-4")
    input_text = "Long article text here..."

    # Act
    result = summarizer.summarize(input_text)

    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert len(result) < len(input_text)
    # TEST FAILS - Summarizer class doesn't exist yet
```

**Phase 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)**

```python
# src/chains/summarizer.py

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

class Summarizer:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model)
        self.prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
            "Summarize the following text:\n\n{text}"
        )

    def summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        chain = self.prompt | self.llm
        response = chain.invoke({"text": text})
        return response.content
        # TEST PASSES - minimal functionality works
```

**Phase 3: REFACTOR (Improve Design)**

```python
# src/chains/summarizer.py

import logging
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Summarizer:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4", max_length: int = 500):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model)
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
            "Summarize in {max_length} chars:\n\n{text}"
        )

    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential())
    def summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        if not text or not text.strip():
            raise ValueError("Input text cannot be empty")

        try:
            chain = self.prompt | self.llm
            response = chain.invoke({
                "text": text,
                "max_length": self.max_length
            })
            return response.content
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Summarization failed")
            raise
        # TESTS STILL PASS - improved code quality
```

### TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Visualization

```
Phase 1: 🔴 RED
├── Write test for feature X
├── Run test → FAILS ❌
└── Commit: "Add failing test for X"

Phase 2: 🟢 GREEN
├── Write minimal code
├── Run test → PASSES ✅
└── Commit: "Implement X to pass tests"

Phase 3: 🔵 REFACTOR
├── Improve code quality
├── Run test → STILL PASSES ✅
├── Extract helper methods
├── Run test → STILL PASSES ✅
├── Improve naming
├── Run test → STILL PASSES ✅
└── Commit: "Refactor X for better design"

Repeat for next feature →
```

### Benefits of This Approach

**Safety**: Tests catch regressions immediately
**Design**: Tests force you to think about API design first
**Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior
**Confidence**: Refactor without fear of breaking things
**Quality**: Higher code coverage from day one
**Debugging**: Failures point to exact problem area
